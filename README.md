# Hangman-Evil-Version

This version of hangman changes the "hidden word" after the player's every guess to maximize difficulty. As a compensation for the players, the players get to decide the size of the word and the number of attempts he/she gets in a game. This customiization allows the player to pick their own difficulties.

Written in C with self created string and vector functions.
